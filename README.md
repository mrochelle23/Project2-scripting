Git Component for Scripting Project

### Overview

The problem descriptions and details are on Prairielearn.
For the git component of the project, you will need
to commit and upload your code to this github repo.

Your score for the git component will be based on:
* Commit message quality.  This won't be judged that harshly, but
  random letters, primarily one word commit messages,
  or repeating the same commit message for each commit
  will lose you points.  I expect these to be something
  you could actually use to identify the different parts
  of the project.
* Number of commits (the point here isn't to have a bunch
  of commits, just to make sure you are committing along
  the way -- having only 1 or 2 commits will definitely
  lose you points).  At the bare minimum, I expect
  one commit per part of the project.
* Using git correctly:  you need to be using git correctly
  from the command line.  This means that you should not just
  be using the file upload option on Github's website.

Note:  you are free to remove or rearrange the files already
in this repository (they are solely there for your convenience)
